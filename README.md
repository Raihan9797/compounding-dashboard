# Compounding Dashboard

This is a dashboard hosted on Heroku to visualize compounding over time and comparing returns between 2 different "investing" strategies. A simple example has been set as the default values to explain the different inputs.

## Example: Mary vs John, and the importance of investing early.
*Note: This was adapted from a chapter in the book: Show Me the Money by Teh Hooi Ling.*

### Mary
1. Starts saving at age 19.
2. Saves $2000 from every year from age 19 to 25 and then stops. (ie a total contribution of $14,000 invested)

### John
1. Starts investing at 26
2. He is very disciplined. From 26 to 65, he puts $2000 yearly into his savings (ie contribution of $80,000 invested)

#### Assuming both are able to generate returns of 10% per year on their portfolios, whose portfolio will be larger at age 65?
***John's is admittedly bigger, but the difference is quite negligible at age 65.*** Mary's portfolio would be $945k while John's would be $974k. This is despite Mary only putting in only $14,000 over seven years vs John's $80,000 contribution over 40 years! That's the magic of compounding :). Try the dashboard out and see for yourself.
